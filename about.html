        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Hi, I’m <strong>Jaleelah Bachou</strong>, an IT student who loves anything that blends
          creativity with technology. This site started as a project for IT 3203, but it also reflects
          my real interest in nature-inspired, eco-conscious jewelry.
        </p>

      <p>
        I’m an international student who moved to the U.S. for college, and that experience pushed me
        to become more independent, resourceful, and intentional about the work I do. I’ve always been
        drawn to art, fashion, and design, but I also enjoy solving technical problems and building
        things from scratch. Web development felt like the perfect space where those interests could meet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This jewelry blog brings those pieces together. On the surface, it’s a simple class website
        about eco-luxury jewelry. Underneath, it’s me practicing how to research a topic, organize content,
        and design a site that feels clean, modern, and easy to use on any device. The focus on reclaimed
        gold, recycled diamonds, and sustainable design connects to how I see the world: style shouldn’t
        have to come at the cost of people or the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of class, I enjoy writing music, designing, cooking, and hanging out with people I love.
        I tend to see creativity as a lifestyle, not just a hobby. Whether it’s planning a website, styling
        a look, or brainstorming a new idea, I like projects that feel personal and meaningful. This site
        is one step in my journey toward a career where I can mix tech, design, and story-telling.
